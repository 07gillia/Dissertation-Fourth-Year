\section*{Notes for the final paper}

\subsection*{Data}
- taken from a website
- between dates
- in format
- using R and shell scripts managed
- put into a single file
- read in
- initially had an issue with data, not enough
- was rectified and the same steps were followed to put it in the same format
- dumbing of the data was done ? might not mention this

\subsection*{Notes}
- ghomas has suggested that we run the code on the GPU as we are running a rolling average
- It could be run on hamilton
- This will take some research but we will continue in the research department first
- Then we will do this parallelism
- then we will implement some of the researched techniques
