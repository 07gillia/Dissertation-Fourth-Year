- This book was found in Durham library using the search term "algorithmic trading". \newline
- The first chapter is a fairly outdated history of algorithmic trading and goes through the terms that will be used in the book. It also goes through how algorithmic trading was used in the late 2000s, namely to break up large buy or sell orders so as to reduce the effect that this has on the valuation of the stock.
