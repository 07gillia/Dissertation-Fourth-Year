Things that need to be implemented
- When to buy
- When to sell
- How much to buy

have implemented a function to calculate the average and it seems to be faster

- How likely it is to go up and thus how much to buy

- look into statistic methods
- alpha and beta. these are going to hard to implement as more data is needed
- might use as a metric at the end?
- sharpe ratio
- have a look at some other stats stuff, maybe ask someone from maths?
- could also look at the research some other stuff
- lots of papers have been saved
- have a look at the list of things that could be implemented in the fourth year folder

- second term should be machine learning
- SVM
- Neural Network?
