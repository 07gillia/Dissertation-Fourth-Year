abstract = {There is a growing interest in support vector machines (SVMs) as tools in ecological prediction and classification. SVMs use separating hyperplanes and exploit theorems bounding the actual risk by the empirical risk to find the optimal decision rule. SVMs do not rely on any distributional assumptions or asymptotic arguments and therefore can be used on small data sets. They are especially valuable for high-dimensional data. This article introduces the underlying mathematical theory of SVMs and discusses their use in ecological investigations.},

abstract = {Technical and quantitative analysis in financial trading use mathematical and statistical tools to help investors decide on the optimum moment to initiate and close orders. While these traditional approaches have served their purpose to some extent, new techniques arising from the field of computational intelligence such as machine learning and data mining have emerged to analyse financial information. While the main financial engineering research has focused on complex computational models such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, there are also simpler models that have demonstrated their usefulness in applications other than financial trading, and are worth considering to determine their advantages and inherent limitations when used as trading analysis tools. This paper analyses the role of simple machine learning models to achieve profitable trading through a series of trading simulations in the FOREX market. It assesses the performance of the models and how particular setups of the models produce systematic and consistent predictions for profitable trading. Due to the inherent complexities of financial time series the role of attribute selection, periodic retraining and training set size are discussed in order to obtain a combination of those parameters not only capable of generating positive cumulative returns for each one of the machine learning models but also to demonstrate how simple algorithms traditionally precluded from financial forecasting for trading applications presents similar performances as their more complex counterparts. The paper discusses how a combination of attributes in addition to technical indicators that has been used as inputs of the machine learning-based predictors such as price related features, seasonality features and lagged values used in classical time series analysis are used to enhance the classification capabilities that impacts directly into the final profitability.},

Using the physical concepts and mathematical structures of quantum mechanics, we construct an econophysical framework for the stock market, based on which we analogously map massive numbers of single stocks into a reservoir consisting of many quantum harmonic oscillators and their stock index into a typical quantum open system—a quantum Brownian particle. In particular, the irrationality of stock transactions is quantitatively considered as the Planck constant within Heisenberg's uncertainty relationship of quantum mechanics in an analogous manner. We analyze real stock data of Shanghai Stock Exchange of China and investigate fat-tail phenomena and non-Markovian behaviors of the stock index with the assistance of the quantum Brownian motion model, thereby interpreting and studying the limitations of the classical Brownian motion model for the efficient market hypothesis from a new perspective of quantum open system dynamics.},

abstract = {This paper presents a Robust Genetic Programming approach for discovering profitable trading rules which are used to manage a portfolio of stocks from the Spanish market. The investigated method is used to determine potential buy and sell conditions for stocks, aiming to yield robust solutions able to withstand extreme market conditions, while producing high returns at a minimal risk. One of the biggest challenges GP evolved solutions face is over-fitting. GP trading rules need to have similar performance when tested with new data in order to be deployed in a real situation. We explore a random sampling method (RSFGP) which instead of calculating the fitness over the whole dataset, calculates it on randomly selected segments. This method shows improved robustness and out-of-sample results compared to standard genetic programming (SGP) and a volatility adjusted fitness (VAFGP). Trading strategies (TS) are evolved using financial metrics like the volatility, CAPM alpha and beta, and the Sharpe ratio alongside other Technical Indicators (TI) to find the best investment strategy. These strategies are evaluated using 21 of the most liquid stocks of the Spanish market. The achieved results clearly outperform Buy{\&}Hold, SGP and VAFGP. Additionally, the solutions obtained with the training data during the experiments clearly show during testing robustness to step market declines as seen during the European sovereign debt crisis experienced recently in Spain. In this paper the solutions learned were able to operate for prolonged periods, which demonstrated the validity and robustness of the rules learned, which are able to operate continuously and with minimal human intervention. To sum up, the developed method is able to evolve TSs suitable for all market conditions with promising results, which suggests great potential in the method generalization capabilities. The use of financial metrics alongside popular TI enables the system to increase the stock return while proving resilient through time. The RSFGP system is able to cope with different types of markets achieving a portfolio return of 31.81{\%} for the testing period 2009-2013 in the Spanish market, having the IBEX35 index returned 2.67{\%}.},

abstract = {Knowledge discovery is an important aspect of human cognition. The advantage of the visual approach is in opportunity to substitute some complex cognitive tasks by easier perceptual tasks. However for cognitive tasks such as financial investment decision making this opportunity faces the challenge that financial data are abstract multidimensional and multivariate, i.e., outside of traditional visual perception in 2D or 3D world. This paper presents an approach to find an investment strategy based on pattern discovery in multidimensional space of specifically prepared time series. Visualization based on the lossless Collocated Paired Coordinates (CPC) plays an important role in this approach for building the criteria in the multidimensional space for finding an efficient investment strategy. Criteria generated with the CPC approach allow reducing/compressing space using simple directed graphs with beginnings and the ends located in different time points. The dedicated subspaces constructed for time series include characteristics such as Bollinger Band, difference between moving averages, changes in volume etc. Extensive simulation studies have been performed in learning/testing context. Effective relations were found for one-hour EURUSD pair for recent and historical data. Also the method has been explored for one-day EURUSD time series n 2D and 3D visualization spaces. The main positive result is finding the effective split of a normalized 3D space on 4 × 4 × 4 cubes in the visualization space that leads to a profitable investment decision (long, short position or nothing). The strategy is ready for implementation in algotrading mode.},

We show that HF traders who do not include predictors of short-term-alpha in their strategies are driven out of the market because they are adversely selected by better informed traders},

abstract = {Stock index forecasting is vital for making informed investment decisions. This paper surveys recent literature in the domain of machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence used to forecast stock market movements. The publications are categorised according to the machine learning technique used, the forecasting timeframe, the input variables used, and the evaluation techniques employed. It is found that there is a consensus between researchers stressing the importance of stock index forecasting. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are identified to be the dominant machine learning technique in this area. We conclude with possible future research directions.},

@article{Blokker1000,
abstract = {A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to attempt to distinguish favorable buy conditions on daily historical equity prices. The SVM used a Gaussian kernel and was optimized over sigma and the margin classifier using cross validation. Although encouraging results were initially obtained through optimization, applying the results to obtain a single trading classifier was unsuccessful. Variation in the data made it impossible to find a useful setting for sigma and C that would produce consistent results. The results are a confirmation of the Weak Efficient Market Theory that predicts there is no information within the market that can be used to predict future prices. Introduction Support Vector Machines (SVM) are supervised learning algorithms for classification of data. They have been used successfully in a broad range of purposes from detecting email spam to hand writing recognition. SVM's have become popular because of their ease of implementation in problems requiring classification of data. SVM's separate highly dimensional training data with hyper-planes that maximize the margin between the classification of the data set. Then, from the determination of the best hyper-planes, new data can be classified. In this way, SVM's are a maximum likelihood estimation of the classification.},

@article{Hasbrouck,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
